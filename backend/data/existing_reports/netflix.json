However, it lacks specific information on the entities included in the sustainability reporting, such as subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other controlled entities. The materiality score is moderate because the paragraph indicates some relevance by mentioning the oversight of ESG efforts by the Board and management decisions related to sustainability programs. However, it lacks a clear explanation of why the entities included in sustainability reporting are important to the business and stakeholders"
